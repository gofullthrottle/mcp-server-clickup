Subject: ClickUp MCP Server for Claude Code Multi-Agent Workflows

Hi [Name],

I'm John Freier, creator of the ClickUp MCP Server that extends the native ClickUp integration with advanced features for multi-agent orchestration.

Why I'm reaching out:
• 500+ active users in 4 weeks (validation)
• #1 ranked for "clickup-mcp" on Google (visibility)
• Built specifically for Claude Code workflows (strategic alignment)
• Fills gaps in native MCP (dependencies, custom fields, bulk operations)

Key differentiators:
• 72 tools vs 28 in native MCP (complete ClickUp API coverage)
• Dependency management (critical for agent parallelization)
• Custom field support (agent state tracking)
• OAuth 2.0 + enterprise security (ready for business users)

The ask:
Would Anthropic consider featuring this in the official MCP directory? I've prepared:
• Security audit report
• Performance benchmarks
• Integration guide for Claude Code
• Video tutorials and documentation
• Case studies with measurable ROI

Happy to jump on a call to discuss how this can drive Claude Code adoption among project management users.

Best,
John Freier

# ClickUp MCP Server: Advanced Integration for Multi-Agent Workflows

I built an open-source ClickUp MCP server with 72 tools (vs 28 in native) 
because I needed dependency management and custom fields for coordinating 
AI agents across projects.

- Dependency management (agents can't work in parallel without this)
- Custom fields (track agent state across sessions)
- 72 tools vs 28 (complete ClickUp API coverage)
- OAuth 2.0 (secure, multi-tenant)
- Free tier + $4.99/mo premium

## Demo
[Video: 2-minute walkthrough]

## Open Source
GitHub: [link]
Docs: [link]

Built with CloudFlare Workers (serverless, fast). Happy to answer questions!
```

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] uses ClickUp for project management. Are you exploring 
AI-powered workflows with Claude Code?

Our enterprise MCP server helps teams coordinate multiple AI agents across 
ClickUp projects:

• Dependency management (agents work in parallel, not sequential)
• Custom fields (track agent state and handoffs)
• Bulk operations (10x faster than UI)
• Enterprise security (OAuth, audit logs, SSO-ready)

Results from similar companies:
• 40% reduction in project planning time
• 3x faster multi-agent execution
• 95% reduction in context-switching overhead

Would you be interested in a 30-day enterprise trial for your team?

Best,
John Freier
Founder, ClickUp MCP

## Final Notes

This strategy is designed to be **90% automated** while still maintaining quality and authenticity. The key is setting up the right AI agents and automation workflows, then letting them run while you focus on high-leverage activities (partnerships, enterprise sales, strategic decisions).

The most important early actions:
1. Rank #1 for "clickup-mcp" (drives organic discovery)
2. Get featured by Anthropic (credibility and distribution)
3. Build community (creates network effects)
4. Create template/workflow library (lock-in)

Everything else compounds from there.

**Ship fast, automate aggressively, scale intelligently.**
