# Meta-Prompt: Agentic Revenue Maximization Strategy Generator

## Purpose
This meta-prompt encapsulates the thinking process for creating comprehensive, AI-driven marketing strategies that maximize passive revenue through automation while requiring minimal human oversight.

---

## The Prompt Template

```
I'm launching [PRODUCT/SERVICE] and want to INTENSELY MAXIMIZE revenue through agentic (AI-automated) marketing. Help me create a comprehensive strategy that covers:

### Core Objectives
1. **SEO Domination**: Rank #1 for "[PRIMARY_KEYWORD]" and related terms
2. **Authority Placement**: Get featured by [KEY_PLATFORM/COMPANY]
3. **Distribution Packages**: Create easy-to-install packages/bundles
4. **Strategic Networking**: Lay groundwork to get in front of decision makers
5. **Revenue Optimization**: Convert awareness to revenue through automation

### Strategic Thinking Required

Think proactively and work backwards from success:

**End Goal → Intermediate Steps → Foundational Work**

For example, if the goal is "Get featured by Anthropic":
- ❌ Don't just suggest "email them"
- ✅ Think about:
  - What groundwork must be laid first?
  - How are they being bombarded with requests?
  - What makes a request stand out?
  - Who are the internal champions/influencers?
  - What proof/validation do we need to show?
  - How can we demonstrate value before asking?
  - What strategic content positions us favorably?
  - Which departments should we approach? (hint: cross-department strategy)

### Framework Components

For each marketing channel/tactic, provide:

1. **Automation Level**: What % can be AI-driven vs human-required
2. **Execution Scripts**: Actual code/pseudo-code for AI agents
3. **Success Metrics**: KPIs to track automatically
4. **Time Investment**: Setup time vs ongoing time
5. **ROI Projection**: Expected return for effort invested
6. **Dependencies**: What must happen first
7. **Failure Modes**: What could go wrong and mitigations

### Marketing Channels to Cover

4. **Success Criteria** (measurable outcomes)
5. **Risk Analysis** (what could fail, mitigations)

### Meta-Cognitive Layer

Before suggesting tactics, explicitly think through:
1. **Who is the target customer?** (be specific)
2. **What is the actual value proposition?** (not features, benefits)
3. **Where are they currently?** (channels, platforms)
4. **What do they search for?** (SEO keywords, intent)
5. **Who influences their decisions?** (thought leaders, platforms)
6. **What objections do they have?** (address proactively)
7. **What triggers a purchase?** (conversion moments)

### Special Considerations for [SPECIFIC_CONTEXT]

[Add any domain-specific requirements, e.g.:]
- For developer tools: Focus on GitHub, Hacker News, technical blogs
- For enterprise: Focus on case studies, ROI calculators, security whitepapers
- For consumer: Focus on social proof, testimonials, viral loops
- For AI/ML products: Leverage Claude Code, MCP ecosystem, AI-native users

## Key Patterns to Apply

### Pattern 1: Reverse Engineer Success

**Instead of**: "We should get featured by [COMPANY]"
**Think**: 
1. Who decides what gets featured?
2. What criteria do they use?
3. What proof do they need?
4. Who already succeeded? How?
5. What groundwork must we lay?
6. What content positions us well?
7. Which internal champions can help?

### Pattern 2: Leverage Compounding

**Instead of**: One-off tactics
**Think**:
1. What creates network effects?
2. How does each user bring more users?
3. What content generates more content?
4. How do small wins create bigger wins?
5. What builds long-term moat?

### Pattern 3: Automate Ruthlessly

**Instead of**: Manual execution
**Think**:
1. What decisions can AI make?
2. What patterns can be codified?
3. Where is human judgment essential?
4. How do we monitor without micromanaging?
5. What are the feedback loops?

### Pattern 4: Multi-Channel Synergy

**Instead of**: Isolated campaigns
**Think**:
1. How does SEO feed social?
2. How does community build authority?
3. How does content support sales?
4. How do partnerships amplify reach?
5. What are the cross-channel opportunities?

### Pattern 5: Build the Flywheel

**Instead of**: Linear growth
**Think**:
1. What is the first spin? (initial push)
2. What makes it spin faster? (momentum builders)
3. What reduces friction? (remove barriers)
4. What adds energy? (growth loops)
5. What makes it self-sustaining?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Generic marketing advice ("build an email list", "post on social media")

❌ **Don't**: Assume unlimited budget/time
✅ **Do**: Prioritize by ROI and leverage (80/20 rule)

❌ **Don't**: Ignore what's already working
✅ **Do**: Build on existing traction and momentum

❌ **Don't**: Focus solely on acquisition
✅ **Do**: Include retention, expansion, and referral strategies

1. **Be 80%+ automatable** (AI agents + scripts)
2. **Have clear ROI metrics** (measurable outcomes)
3. **Compound over time** (network effects, flywheels)
4. **Require <10 hrs/week human time** (after setup)
5. **Generate passive revenue** (while you build other things)
